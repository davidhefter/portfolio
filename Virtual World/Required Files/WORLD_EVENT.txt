How to trigger event:
Clicking on any entity-free tile in the world triggers the event.

What should happen when the event is triggered:
- If a non mushroom background tile is clicked, it and six random background tiles surrounding it 
  (unless there are fewer than six within bounds that aren't a bridge) are transformed into mushrooms.

- If a mushroom background tile is clicked, it and six random background tiles surrounding it 
  (unless there are fewer than six within bounds that aren't a bridge) are transformed into either grass or flowers (50-50).
- If a non mushroom background tile is clicked, a new Wizard entity is created at that spot.

- Any Skeletons within proximity of the event transform into DudeNotFulls.
- Any Fairies within proximity of the event transform into Wizards.
- Any Wizards within proximity of the event transform into DudeNotFulls.

What the affected entities should do:
- BigMushrooms have no activity, just like Stumps.
- Dudes created from the event are DudeNotFulls.

- Skeletons move towards Fairies and other Skeletons.
- Skeletons convert Fairies into BigMushrooms when it reaches them.
- Skeletons convert other Skeletons into Wizards when it reaches them.

- Fairies now target Skeletons, Stumps, and BigMushrooms, with a priority on Skeletons and Mushrooms
- Fairies now convert Skeletons to Dudes when it reaches them.
- Fairies now convert Stumps and BigMushrooms to Saplings when it reaches them
- Fairies now turn mushroom backgrounds into either grass or flower backgrounds when it walks on them.

- Dudes now additionally move towards Wizards and BigMushrooms.
- Dudes convert Wizards into Stumps when it reaches them.
- Dudes convert Mushrooms into Fairies when it reaches them.

What the new entity is and how it should behave:
- Wizards move towards Trees, Stumps, Saplings, and Dudes.
- Wizards turn Trees and Stumps into Mushrooms when it reaches them.
- Wizards turn Saplings into Skeletons when it reaches them.
- Wizards turn grass/flower background into mushroom backgrounds when it walks on them.
